## About Me
I am a medical doctor and public health physician working in government sector in the southern state of Kerala in India. This blog documents part of my work and experiences as a person in public health. It is an effort to understand the nuances and the wide gamut of challenges faced by people in pursuit of good health and well-being. I subscribe to the values of [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/) and is particularly committed to Goal 3: *Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.*
